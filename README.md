## What is this?

This is a personal, yet public FAQ about technical notes and answers I've created over time when either of the 2 following situations occurs:

1. I've had to look up the same information more than 2 times
2. One or more people have asked me the same information more than 2 times

It was originally written with _future me_ as the intended audience so this isn't a complete 100% accurate guide to any of the topics covered. It doesn't aim to be. It's more a FAQ, TL;DR, or equivalent _gist_ of something that helps remind me of stuff. Hopefully it's useful to you too.



## Framing ideas

Like the idea of zines by Julia Evans [https://wizardzines.com/zines/bite-size-command-line/](https://wizardzines.com/zines/bite-size-command-line/) but for _concept_ knowledge about things as well. 

Or JIT just-in-time knowledge for interdisciplinary folks with non-formal backgrounds.
